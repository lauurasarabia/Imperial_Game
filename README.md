# GeoSpatial | Project 3

Imperial Game is analyzing the environment around the world in order to choose where they will be placed at. 

On the one hand, they have used MongoDB as they had a database with all the information about other tech companies. They imported it to Jupyter Notebook for being able to work with the information. 
After counting how many tech offices are for each city around the world, they realized that the Top 3 cities are: 
- San Francisco
- New York
- London

### San Francisco
As the company has different requirements to accomplish for their employees to be happy and comfortable, they decided to go for San Francisco, since is the one that matches almost all of them. 
Besides, there is a bonus point as in San Francisco takes place the "Games Developer Conference" every March, so they have the golden opportunity to assist.

These are the requirements that Imperial Game took into account at the time of choosing a place:
- Schools: 30% of the company staff have at least 1 child.
- Starbucks: Executives like Starbucks A LOT. They need some place to go for a break in hard days.
- Airport nearby: Account managers need to travel a lot.
- Night Clubs/ Bars: Everyone in the company is between 25 and 40, some place to go party.
- Vegan Restaurants: The CEO is vegan. 
- Basketball Stadium: Maintenance guy loves basketball, it should be around 10 Km.

They have decided to place their company at the New Montgomery St office, as it is the one that accomplish all of the requirements and offers more choice of them. Besides, it is the one closer to the Financial District of San Francisco. For this reason they believe this is the best option of being ideally located by both employees and company.
