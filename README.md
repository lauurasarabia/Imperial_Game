# GeoSpatial | Project 3

A Gaming company is analyzing the environment around the world in order to choose where they will be installated at. 

On the one hand, they have used MongoDB as they had a database with all the information about other tech companies. They imported it to Jupyter Notebook for being able to work with the information. 
After counting how many tech offices are for each city around the world, they realized that the Top 3 cities are: 
- San Francisco
- New York
- London

### San Francisco
As the company has different requirements to accomplish for their employees to be happy, they decided to go for San Francisco, since is the one that matches almost all of them. 
Besides, there is a bonus point as in San Francisco takes place the "Games Developer Conference" every March.
